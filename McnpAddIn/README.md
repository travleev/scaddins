# MCNP Add-In
MCNP-related commands.

__Get volumes:__ writes volumes of all bodies into external text file. This is useful to compare the CAD volumes with MCNP volumes, as found in the outp file or calculated stochastically.

__Plot:__ puts MCNP plot commands correspondent to current view to the windows CLipboard. The current view must be in sketch mode. This helps to visually compare geometry, as shown in SpaceClaim and plotted by MCNP.
